# Probability that an outbreak will be contained

```r
probability_contain(
  R,
  k,
  num_init_infect,
  ind_control = 0,
  pop_control = 0,
  simulate = FALSE,
  ...,
  case_threshold = 100,
  outbreak_time = Inf,
  generation_time = NULL,
  offspring_dist
)
```

## Arguments

- `R`: A `number` specifying the R parameter (i.e. average secondary cases per infectious individual).
- `k`: A `number` specifying the k parameter (i.e. overdispersion in offspring distribution from fitted negative binomial).
- `num_init_infect`: An `integer` (or at least ["integerish"](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/is_integerish.html) if stored as double) specifying the number of initial infections.
- `ind_control`: A `numeric` specifying the strength of individual-level control measures. These control measures assume that infected individuals do not produce any secondary infections with probability `ind_control`, thus increasing the proportion of cases that do not create any subsequent infections. The control measure is between `0` (default) and `1` (maximum).
- `pop_control`: A `numeric` specifying the strength of population-level control measures that reduce the transmissibility of all cases by a constant factor. Between `0` (default) and `1` (maximum).
- `simulate`: A `logical` boolean determining whether the probability of containment is calculated analytically or numerically using a stochastic branching process model. Default is `FALSE` which calls `probability_extinct()`, setting to `TRUE` uses a branching process and enables setting the `case_threshold`, `outbreak_time` and `generation_time`
    
    arguments.
- `...`: <`dynamic-dots`> Named elements to replace default arguments in `.chain_sim()`. See details.
- `case_threshold`: A number for the threshold of the number of cases below which the epidemic is considered contained. `case_threshold` is only used when `simulate = TRUE`.
- `outbreak_time`: A number for the time since the start of the outbreak to determine if outbreaks are contained within a given period of time. `outbreak_time` is only used when `simulate = TRUE`.
- `generation_time`: A `function` to generate generation times. The function must have a single argument and return a `numeric` vector with generation times. See details for example. The `function` can be defined or anonymous. `generation_time` is only used when `simulate = TRUE`.
- `offspring_dist`: An `<epiparameter>` object. An S3 class for working with epidemiological parameters/distributions, see `epiparameter::epiparameter()`.

## Returns

A `number` for the probability of containment.

Outbreak containment is defined as outbreak extinction when `simulate = FALSE`. When `simulate = FALSE`, `probability_contain()` is equivalent to calling `probability_extinct()`.

When `simulate = TRUE`, outbreak containment is defined by the `case_threshold` (default = 100) and `outbreak_time` arguments. Firstly, `case_threshold` sets the size of the transmission chain below which the outbreak is considered contained. Secondly, `outbreak_time` sets the time duration from the start of the outbreak within which the outbreak is contained if there is no more onwards transmission beyond this time. When setting an `outbreak_time`, a `generation_time` is also required. `case_threshold` and `outbreak_time` can be jointly set. Overall, when `simulate = TRUE`, containment is defined as the size and time duration of a transmission chain not reaching the `case_threshold`

and `outbreak_time`, respectively.

## Details

When using `simulate = TRUE`, the default arguments to simulate the transmission chains with `.chain_sim()` are 10 5 replicates, a negative binomial (`nbinom`) offspring distribution, parameterised with `R` (and `pop_control` if > 0) and `k`.

When setting the `outbreak_time` argument, the `generation_time` argument is also required. The `generation_time` argument requires a random number generator function. For example, if we assume the generation time is lognormally distributed with `meanlog = 1` and `sdlog = 1.5`, then we can define the `function` to pass to `generation_time` as:

 

```
function(x) rlnorm(x, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 1.5)
```

 

## Examples

```r
# population-level control measures
probability_contain(R = 1.5, k = 0.5, num_init_infect = 1, pop_control = 0.1)

# individual-level control measures
probability_contain(R = 1.5, k = 0.5, num_init_infect = 1, ind_control = 0.1)

# both levels of control measures
probability_contain(
  R = 1.5,
  k = 0.5,
  num_init_infect = 1,
  ind_control = 0.1,
  pop_control = 0.1
)

# multi initial infections with population-level control measures
probability_contain(R = 1.5, k = 0.5, num_init_infect = 5, pop_control = 0.1)

# probability of containment within a certain amount of time
# this requires parameterising a generation time
gt <- function(n) {
  rlnorm(n, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 1.5)
}
probability_contain(
  R = 1.2,
  k = 0.5,
  num_init_infect = 1,
  simulate = TRUE,
  case_threshold = 50,
  outbreak_time = 20,
  generation_time = gt
)
```
