# Calculate the reproduction number (`R`) for a (heterogeneous) network

```r
calc_network_R(
  mean_num_contact,
  sd_num_contact,
  infect_duration,
  prob_transmission,
  age_range
)
```

## Arguments

- `mean_num_contact`: A `numeric`, mean (average) number of new contacts per unit time.
- `sd_num_contact`: A `numeric`, standard deviation of the number of new contacts per unit time.
- `infect_duration`: A `numeric`, the duration of infectiousness.
- `prob_transmission`: A `numeric` probability of transmission per contact, also known as `\beta`.
- `age_range`: A `numeric` vector with two elements, the lower and upper age limits of individuals in the network.

## Returns

A named `numeric` vector of length 2, the unadjusted (`R`) and network adjusted (`R_net`) estimates of `R`.

The calculation of the reproduction number adjusting for heterogeneity in number of contacts.

## Examples

```r
# example using NATSAL data
calc_network_R(
  mean_num_contact = 14.1,
  sd_num_contact = 69.6,
  infect_duration = 1,
  prob_transmission = 1,
  age_range = c(16, 74)
)
```
