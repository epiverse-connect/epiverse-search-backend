# Simulate transmission chains using a stochastic branching process

```r
.chain_sim(
  n,
  offspring,
  stat = c("size", "length"),
  stat_threshold = Inf,
  generation_time,
  tf = Inf,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- `n`: Number of simulations to run.
- `offspring`: Offspring distribution: a character string corresponding to the R distribution function (e.g., "pois" for Poisson, where `rpois()` is the R function to generate Poisson random numbers).
- `stat`: String; Statistic to calculate. Can be one of:
    
     * "size": the total number of offspring.
     * "length": the total number of ancestors.
- `stat_threshold`: A size or length above which the simulation results should be set to `Inf`. Defaults to `Inf`, resulting in no results ever set to `Inf`
- `generation_time`: The generation time generator function; the name of a user-defined named or anonymous function with only one argument `n`, representing the number of generation times to generate.
- `tf`: End time (if `generation_time` interval is given).
- `...`: Parameters of the offspring distribution as required by R.

## Returns

A `<data.frame>` with columns `n` (simulation ID), `id` (a unique ID within each simulation for each individual element of the chain), `ancestor` (the ID of the ancestor of each element), and `generation`. A `time` column is also appended if the generation_time interval is supplied to `serial`.

Code modified from the `bpmodels::chain_sim()` function. The function `chain_sim()` function from `bpmodels` is reused with permission and licensed under MIT as is `bpmodels`. `bpmodels` is not on CRAN and is retired.
