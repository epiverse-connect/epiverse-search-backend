# Constructor for `<epiparameter>` class

```r
new_epiparameter(
  disease = character(),
  pathogen = character(),
  epi_name = character(),
  prob_distribution = list(),
  uncertainty = list(),
  summary_stats = list(),
  citation = character(),
  metadata = list(),
  method_assess = list(),
  notes = character(),
  auto_calc_params = logical(),
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- `disease`: A `character` string with name of the infectious disease.
- `pathogen`: A `character` string with the name of the causative agent of disease, or `NA` if not known.
- `epi_name`: A `character` string with the name of the epidemiological parameter type.
- `prob_distribution`: An S3 class containing the probability distribution or a character string if the parameters of the probability distribution are unknown but the name of the distribution is known, or `NA`
    
    if the distribution name and parameters are unknown. Use `create_prob_distribution()` to create `prob_distribution`.
- `uncertainty`: A list of named vectors with the uncertainty around the probability distribution parameters. If uncertainty around the parameter estimates is unknown use `create_uncertainty()` (which is the argument default) to create a list with the correct names with missing values.
- `summary_stats`: A list of summary statistics, use `create_summary_stats()` to create list. This list can include summary statistics about the inferred distribution such as it's mean and standard deviation, quantiles of the distribution, or information about the data used to fit the distribution such as lower and upper range. The summary statistics can also include uncertainty around metrics such as confidence interval around mean and standard deviation.
- `citation`: A `<bibentry>` with the citation of the source of the data or the paper that inferred the distribution parameters, use `create_citation()` to create citation.
- `metadata`: A list of metadata, this can include: units, sample size, the transmission mode of the disease (e.g. is it vector-borne or directly transmitted), etc. It is assumed that the disease is not vector-borne and that the distribution is intrinsic (e.g. not an extrinsic delay distribution such as extrinsic incubation period) unless `transmission_mode = "vector_borne"` is contained in the metadata. Use `create_metadata()` to create metadata.
- `method_assess`: A list of methodological aspects used when fitting the distribution, use `create_method_assess()` to create method assessment.
- `notes`: A `character` string with any additional information about the data, inference method or disease.
- `auto_calc_params`: A boolean `logical` determining whether to try and calculate the probability distribution parameters from summary statistics if distribution parameters are not provided. Default is `TRUE`. In the case when sufficient summary statistics are provided and the parameter(s) of the distribution are not, the `.calc_dist_params()` function is called to calculate the parameters and add them to the `epiparameter` object created.
- `...`: dots Extra arguments to be passed to internal functions.
    
    This is most commonly used to pass arguments to `distcrete::distcrete()`
    
    that construct the discretised distribution S3 object. To see which arguments can be adjusted for discretised distributions see `distcrete::distcrete()`.

## Returns

An `<epiparameter>` object.

Create an `<epiparameter>` object. The constructor will search whether parameters of the probability distribution are supplied and if not look to see whether they can be inferred/extracted/ converted from summary statistics provided. It will also convert the probability distribution (`prob_dist`) and its parameters (`prob_dist_params`) into an S3 class, either a `distribution` object from `{distributional}` when `discretise = FALSE`, or a `distcrete` object from `{distcrete}` when `discretise = TRUE`.
