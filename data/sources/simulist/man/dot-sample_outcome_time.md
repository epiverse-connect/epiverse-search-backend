# Sample the onset-to-outcome time conditional that the outcome is after a hospitalisation event

```r
.sample_outcome_time(.data, onset_to_outcome, idx)
```

## Arguments

- `.data`: A `<data.frame>` containing the infectious history from a branching process simulation (`.sim_network_bp()`).
- `onset_to_outcome`: A `function` for either the onset-to-death or onset-to-recovery delay distribution. `onset_to_outcome` can also be set to `NULL` to not simulate dates for individuals that died or recovered. See `sim_linelist()` documentation for more information.
- `idx`: Either the `infected_lgl_idx` or `died_lgl_idx` from `.add_outcomes()` to define who to sample recovery or death times for, respectively.

## Returns

A `<data.frame>` with a potentially modified `$outcome_time` column.

The outcome of a case, either died or recovered, can have a time of event, but this must be after the hospitalisation time, if a case has been admitted to hospital. This function samples either the onset-to-death or onset-to-recovery time conditional on it being greater than a onset-to-hospitalisation time for a given case, if the case was admitted to hospital. It does this by resampling onset-to-outcome (death or recovery) times if they are less than the onset-to-hospitalisation time (from `.add_hospitalisation()`).
