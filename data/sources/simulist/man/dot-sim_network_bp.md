# Simulate a random network branching process model with a probability of infection for each contact

```r
.sim_network_bp(
  contact_distribution,
  infectious_period,
  prob_infection,
  max_outbreak_size,
  config
)
```

## Arguments

- `contact_distribution`: A `function` or an `<epiparameter>` object to generate the number of contacts per infection.
    
    The function can be defined or anonymous. The function must have a single argument in the form of an `integer` vector with elements representing the number of contacts, and return a `numeric` vector where each element corresponds to the probability of observing the number of contacts in the vector passed to the function. The index of the `numeric` vector returned is offset by one to the corresponding probability of observing the number of contacts, i.e. the first element of the output vector is the probability of observing zero contacts, the second element is the probability of observing one contact, etc.
    
    An `<epiparameter>` can be provided. This will be converted into a probability mass function internally.
    
    The default is an anonymous function with a Poisson probability mass function (`dpois()`) with a mean (`\lambda`) of 2 contacts per infection.
- `infectious_period`: A `function` or an `<epiparameter>` object for the infectious period. This defines the duration from becoming infectious to no longer infectious. In the simulation, individuals are assumed to become infectious immediately after being infected (the latency period is assumed to be zero). The time intervals between an infected individual and their contacts are assumed to be uniformly distributed within the infectious period. Infectious periods must be strictly positive.
    
    The function can be defined or anonymous. The function must return a vector of randomly generated real numbers representing sampled infectious periods. The function must have a single argument, the number of random infectious periods to generate.
    
    An `<epiparameter>` can be provided. This will be converted into random number generator internally.
    
    The default is an anonymous function with a lognormal distribution random number generator (`rlnorm()`) with `meanlog = 2` and `sdlog = 0.5`.
- `prob_infection`: A single `numeric` for the probability of a secondary contact being infected by an infected primary contact.
- `config`: A list of settings to adjust the randomly sampled delays and Ct values. See `create_config()` for more information.

## Returns

A `<data.frame>` with the contact and transmission chain data.

Simulate a branching process on a infinite network where the contact distribution provides a function to sample the number of contacts of each individual in the simulation. Each contact is then infected with the probability of infection. The time between each contact is assumed to be evenly distributed across the infectious period of the infected individual, and is independent of whether the contact becomes infected.

## Details

The contact distribution sampled takes the network effect `q(n) \sim (n + 1)p(n + 1)` where `p(n)` is the probability density function of a distribution, e.g., Poisson or Negative binomial. That is to say, the probability of having choosing a contact at random by following up a contact chooses individuals with a probability proportional to their number of contacts. The plus one is because one of the contacts was "used" to infect the person.
