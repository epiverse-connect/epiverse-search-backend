# Cross check the onset-to-hospitalisation or -death arguments are compatible with hospitalisation and death risks

```r
.cross_check_sim_input(
  onset_to_hosp,
  onset_to_death,
  hosp_risk,
  hosp_death_risk,
  non_hosp_death_risk
)
```

## Arguments

- `onset_to_hosp`: A `function` or an `<epiparameter>` object for the onset-to-hospitalisation delay distribution. `onset_to_hosp` can also be set to `NULL` to not simulate hospitalisation (admission) dates.
    
    The function can be defined or anonymous. The function must return a vector of `numeric`s for the length of the onset-to-hospitalisation delay. The function must have a single argument.
    
    An `<epiparameter>` can be provided. This will be converted into a random number generator internally.
    
    The default is an anonymous function with a lognormal distribution random number generator (`rlnorm()`) with `meanlog = 1.5` and `sdlog = 0.5`.
    
    If `onset_to_hosp` is set to `NULL` then `hosp_risk` and `hosp_death_risk`
    
    will be automatically set to `NULL` if not manually specified.
- `onset_to_death`: A `function` or an `<epiparameter>` object for the onset-to-death delay distribution. `onset_to_death` can also be set to `NULL` to not simulate dates for individuals that died.
    
    The function can be defined or anonymous. The function must return a vector of `numeric`s for the length of the onset-to-death delay. The function must have a single argument.
    
    An `<epiparameter>` can be provided. This will be converted into a random number generator internally.
    
    The default is an anonymous function with a lognormal distribution random number generator (`rlnorm()`) with `meanlog = 2.5` and `sdlog = 0.5`.
    
    If `onset_to_death` is set to `NULL` then `non_hosp_death_risk` and `hosp_death_risk` will be automatically set to `NULL` if not manually specified.
    
    For hospitalised cases, the function ensures the onset-to-death time is greater than the onset-to-hospitalisation time. After many (1000) attempts, if an onset-to-death time (from `onset_to_death`) cannot be sampled that is greater than a onset-to-hospitalisation time (from `onset_to_hosp`) then the function will error. Due to this conditional sampling, the onset-to-death times in the line list may not resemble the distributional form input into the function.
- `hosp_risk`: Either a single `numeric` for the hospitalisation risk of everyone in the population, or a `<data.frame>` with age specific hospitalisation risks. Default is 20% hospitalisation (`0.2`) for the entire population. If the `onset_to_hosp` argument is set to `NULL` this argument will automatically be set to `NULL` if not specified or can be manually set to `NULL`. See details and examples for more information.
- `hosp_death_risk`: Either a single `numeric` for the death risk for hospitalised individuals across the population, or a `<data.frame>` with age specific hospitalised death risks Default is 50% death risk in hospitals (`0.5`) for the entire population. If the `onset_to_death` argument is set to `NULL` this argument will automatically be set to `NULL` if not specified or can be manually set to `NULL`. See details and examples for more information. The `hosp_death_risk` can vary through time if specified in the `time_varying_death_risk` element of `config`, see `vignette("time-varying-cfr", package = "simulist")` for more information.
- `non_hosp_death_risk`: Either a single `numeric` for the death risk for outside of hospitals across the population, or a `<data.frame>` with age specific death risks outside of hospitals. Default is 5% death risk outside of hospitals (`0.05`) for the entire population. If the `onset_to_death`
    
    argument is set to `NULL` this argument will automatically be set to `NULL`
    
    if not specified or can be manually set to `NULL`. See details and examples for more information. The `non_hosp_death_risk` can vary through time if specified in the `time_varying_death_risk` element of `config`, see `vignette("time-varying-cfr", package = "simulist")` for more information.

## Returns

Invisibly return the `onset_to_hosp` argument. The function is called for its side-effects, which will error or warn if the input is invalid.

There are two types of cross-checking:

1. If the onset-to-event distribution is specified but the corresponding risk is not specified (i.e. `NULL`) the function will error (`stop()`).
2. If the onset-to-event distribution is not specified (i.e. `NULL`) but the corresponding risk is specified the function will throw a warning (`warning()`).

The difference in condition handling is because in the case that the onset-to-event is `NULL` the simulation can safely ignore the corresponding risk, while throwing a warning, as there are no events. In other words, if the onset-to-hospitalisation is not specified, no infected individuals will go to hospital and the `date_admission` column in the line list will all be `NA`s. However, if the onset-to-event is specified and the corresponding risk is `NULL` then the proportion of individuals infected that are hospitalised or die cannot be calculated and therefore the simulation cannot run. It is in this latter case that the cross-checking throws an error.
