# Plot Vaccine Coverage

```r
plot_coverage(vaccineff_data, date_interval = NULL, cumulative = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- `vaccineff_data`: Object of the class `vaccineff_data` with vaccineff data.
- `date_interval`: If NULL, the function calculates the coverage interval based on the min() and max() of the `vacc_date_col`. It is also possible to pass a custom date interval to truncate or expand the date interval (see example).
- `cumulative`: If `TRUE`, returns the cumulative number of doses over the time window.

## Returns

2-axis ggplot2 plot of vaccine coverage and daily doses.

This function returns a plot of the vaccine coverage or the cumulative coverage (if cumulative = TRUE). The return is a 2-axis `ggplot2`

element with the number of vaccines per date on the left axis and the coverage per date on the right axis. When a matching routine is performed, the left axis also accounts for the doses of the matched cohort.
