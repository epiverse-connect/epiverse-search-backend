# Balance of Vaccinated/Unvaccinated Groups

```r
balance_summary(
  data_set,
  nearest,
  exact,
  vacc_status_col,
  vaccinated_status,
  unvaccinated_status
)
```

## Arguments

- `data_set`: `data.frame` to assess matching balance.
- `nearest`: Named vector with name(s) of column(s) for `nearest` matching and caliper(s) for each variable (e.g., `nearest = c("characteristic1" = n1, "characteristic2" = n2)`, where `n1` and `n2` are the calipers).
- `exact`: Name(s) of column(s) for `exact` matching
- `vacc_status_col`: Name of the column containing the vaccination.
- `vaccinated_status`: Status assigned to the vaccinated population.
- `unvaccinated_status`: Status assigned to the unvaccinated population.

## Returns

Summary `data.frame` with the balance of each variable by vaccine status. Numeric variables are reported with means, and categorical/factor variables are reported with proportions. In both cases, the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) is calculated.

This function creates a summary after matching.
