# Calculate Vaccine Coverage

```r
coh_coverage(
  data_set,
  vacc_date_col,
  unit = c("day", "month", "year"),
  date_interval = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- `data_set`: `data.frame` with cohort information.
- `vacc_date_col`: Name of the column(s) that contain the vaccine date to calculate the coverage.
- `unit`: Aggregation unit, must be either "year", "month", or "day".
- `date_interval`: If NULL, the function calculates the coverage interval based on the min() and max() of the `vacc_date_col`. It is also possible to pass a custom date interval to truncate or expand the date interval (see example).

## Returns

`data.frame` with the number of vaccine doses per date, cumulative count of doses, and vaccine coverage.

This function returns the vaccination coverage of a dose along the cohort study. The coverage can be calculated grouped by year, day, and month. This must be specified in the parameter `unit`. If there are no records for some dates, the function assigns 0 instead of NA to calculate the cumulative coverage.
