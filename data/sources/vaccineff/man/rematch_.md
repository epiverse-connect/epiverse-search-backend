# Rematch Step for Iterative Match

```r
rematch_(
  all,
  adjusted,
  outcome_date_col,
  censoring_date_col,
  immunization_date_col,
  removed_i,

```

## Arguments

- `all`: `data.frame` with the entire cohort.
- `adjusted`: `data.frame` with the adjusted cohort to calculate removed cases. Default is NULL, which returns 0.
- `outcome_date_col`: Name of the column that contains the outcome dates.
- `censoring_date_col`: Name of the column that contains the censoring date.
- `immunization_date_col`: Name of the column that contains the immunization date to set the beginning of the follow-up period (`t0_follow_up`).
- `vacc_status_col`: Name of the column containing the vaccination.
- `nearest`: Named vector with name(s) of column(s) for `nearest` matching and caliper(s) for each variable (e.g., `nearest = c("characteristic1" = n1, "characteristic2" = n2)`, where `n1` and `n2` are the calipers).
- `exact`: Name(s) of column(s) for `exact` matching
- `start_cohort`: Start date of the study.
- `end_cohort`: End date of the study.
- `im`: Iteration number for error message

## Returns

List that contains three `data.frame`: `adjusted`: updated adjusted matches `adjusted_i_s`: new adjusted matches for `rematch_status`

`matched_i_s`: all the new matches for `rematch_status`

This auxiliary function performs the re-matching strategy for `iterate_match()`. It rematches the population with status given by `rematch_status` and excludes the removed population with status `control_status`. A `tryCatch` validation handles errors when no matches can be generated due to the lack of treated or untreated individuals.
