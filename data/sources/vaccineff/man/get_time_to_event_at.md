# Construct Time-to-Event at

```r
get_time_to_event_at(
  data_set,
  outcome_date_col,
  censoring_date_col,
  end_cohort,
  at
)
```

## Arguments

- `data_set`: `data.frame` with cohort information.
- `outcome_date_col`: Name of the column that contains the outcome dates.
- `censoring_date_col`: Name of the column that contains the censoring date.
- `end_cohort`: End date of the study.
- `at`: Time to truncate the follow-up period

## Returns

`data.frame` containing time_to_event and outcome_status

This function returns both the time-to-event until a reference number of days, as provided in `at`, and the outcome status at the same point. It uses the exposure time as an auxiliary variable to calculate the time-to-event. The starting point for counting the time-to-event is `t0_follow_up`, which is determined based on whether a matching strategy is used or not. If the event occurs before the reference date, the end date of the exposure period is used to calculate the time-to-event. This accounts for whether censoring or an event occurred. The outcome status is determined based on whether the outcome date coincides with the end of the follow-up period.
