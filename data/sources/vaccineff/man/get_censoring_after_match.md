# Create Censoring date by Pairs

```r
get_censoring_after_match(data_set, outcome_date_col, censoring_date_col)
```

## Arguments

- `data_set`: `data.frame` with cohort information.
- `outcome_date_col`: Name of the column that contains the outcome dates.
- `censoring_date_col`: Name of the column that contains the censoring date.

This function creates the censoring date of the pairs by inheriting the minimum date in which any of the partners has a censoring event. Two conditions are checked to inherit a censoring date in a pair.

1. Individual censoring occurs before individual event;
2. If an outcome happens before the censoring of the partner no censoring is inherited by the other.
