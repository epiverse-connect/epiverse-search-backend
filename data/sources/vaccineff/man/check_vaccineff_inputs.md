## Arguments

- `data_set`: `data.frame` with cohort information.
- `outcome_date_col`: Name of the column that contains the outcome dates.
- `censoring_date_col`: Name of the column that contains the censoring date. NULL by default.
- `vacc_date_col`: Name of the column(s) that contain the vaccine dates.
- `vacc_name_col`: Name of the column(s) that contain custom vaccine names for the vaccines (e.g. brand name, type of vaccine). If provided, must be of the same length as `vacc_date_col`.
- `vaccinated_status`: Status assigned to the vaccinated population. Default is `v`.
- `unvaccinated_status`: Status assigned to the unvaccinated population. Default is `u`.
- `immunization_delay`: Characteristic time in days before the patient is considered immune. Default is 0.
- `end_cohort`: End date of the study.
- `match`: `TRUE`: cohort matching is performed. Default is `FALSE`
- `exact`: Name(s) of column(s) for `exact` matching. Default is `NULL`.
- `nearest`: Named vector with name(s) of column(s) for `nearest` matching and caliper(s) for each variable (e.g., `nearest = c("characteristic1" = n1, "characteristic2" = n2)`, where `n1` and `n2` are the calipers). Default is `NULL`.
- `take_first`: `FALSE`: takes the latest vaccine date. `TRUE`: takes the earliest vaccine date.
