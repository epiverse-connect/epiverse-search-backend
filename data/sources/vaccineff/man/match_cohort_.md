# Match Cohort Using Mahalanobis Distance

```r
match_cohort_(data_set, vacc_status_col, exact = NULL, nearest = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- `data_set`: `data.frame` with cohort information.
- `vacc_status_col`: Name of the column containing the vaccination.
- `exact`: Name(s) of column(s) for `exact` matching
- `nearest`: Named vector with name(s) of column(s) for `nearest` matching and caliper(s) for each variable (e.g., `nearest = c("characteristic1" = n1, "characteristic2" = n2)`, where `n1` and `n2` are the calipers).

## Returns

`data.frame` with the matched population.

This function constructs pairs of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with similar characteristics. It relies on the matching algorithm implemented in the package `{MatchIt}`. By default, the function uses `method = "nearest"`, `ratio = 1`, and `distance = "mahalanobis"` to perform the matching.
