# Construct Immunization Date

```r
get_immunization_date(
  data_set,
  outcome_date_col,
  censoring_date_col,
  immunization_delay,
  vacc_date_col,
  end_cohort,
  take_first = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- `data_set`: `data.frame` with cohort information.
- `outcome_date_col`: Name of the column that contains the outcome dates.
- `censoring_date_col`: Name of the column that contains the censoring date.
- `immunization_delay`: Characteristic time in days before the patient is considered immune.
- `vacc_date_col`: Name of the column(s) that contain the vaccine dates.
- `end_cohort`: End date of the study.
- `take_first`: `FALSE`: takes the latest vaccine date. `TRUE`: takes the earliest vaccine date.

## Returns

Immunization date

This function constructs the immunization date per individual by searching for the vaccine dates that satisfy the condition: `vacc_date_col + immunization_delay <= limit_date`, where `limit_date` is defined following the hierarchy: `censoring_date_col`, `outcome_date_col`, `end_cohort`. If a date is not provided/found the function takes the next one in the hierarchy. If several columns with vaccine dates are provided, the function selects by default the closest vaccine date to `limit_date`. However, it can also select the first vaccine date by setting `take_first = TRUE`.
