# Static Matching

```r
static_match(
  data_set,
  outcome_date_col,
  censoring_date_col,
  immunization_date_col,
  vacc_status_col,
  vaccinated_status,
  unvaccinated_status,
  start_cohort,
  end_cohort,
  nearest,
  exact
)
```

## Arguments

- `data_set`: `data.frame` with cohort information.
- `outcome_date_col`: Name of the column that contains the outcome dates.
- `censoring_date_col`: Name of the column that contains the censoring date.
- `immunization_date_col`: Name of the column that contains the immunization date to set the beginning of the follow-up period (`t0_follow_up`).
- `vacc_status_col`: Name of the column containing the vaccination.
- `vaccinated_status`: Status assigned to the vaccinated population.
- `unvaccinated_status`: Status assigned to the unvaccinated population.
- `start_cohort`: Start date of the study.
- `end_cohort`: End date of the study.
- `nearest`: Named vector with name(s) of column(s) for `nearest` matching and caliper(s) for each variable (e.g., `nearest = c("characteristic1" = n1, "characteristic2" = n2)`, where `n1` and `n2` are the calipers).
- `exact`: Name(s) of column(s) for `exact` matching

## Returns

List with results from static match: `match`: adjusted cohort, `summary`: matching summary, `balance_all`: balance of the cohort before matching, `balance_matched`: balance of the cohort after matching.

This function calls `match_cohort_` once and then removes the pairs whose exposure times do not coincide. It returns the adjusted cohort, a summary of the matching result, and the balance of the cohort before and after matching.
