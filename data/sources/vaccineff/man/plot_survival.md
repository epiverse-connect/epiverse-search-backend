# Plot the Survival Probability Based on the Kaplan-Meier Model

```r
plot_survival(km, percentage = TRUE, cumulative = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- `km`: Kaplan-Meier estimation created with `km_model`.
- `percentage`: If `TRUE`, returns probability in percentage.
- `cumulative`: If `TRUE`, returns cumulative incidence

## Returns

`{ggplot2}` object with plot of survival or cumulative incidence.

This function relies on the implementation of the Kaplan-Meier model from the package `{survival}`. It returns a plot of the Survival Probability or the Cumulative Hazard (if cumulative = TRUE). The return is a ggplot2 element of the curves with 95% C.I. It is possible to manipulate the colors, labels, legend, and most of the graphic elements.
