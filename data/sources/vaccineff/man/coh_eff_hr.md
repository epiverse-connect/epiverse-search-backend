# Function to Estimate the Vaccine Effectiveness Using Hazard Ratio

)
```

## Returns

VE (CI95%), output from `cox_model`, prediction from `cox_model`, and output from `km_model`

The function relies on the implementation of the Cox model for proportional hazards from the package `{survival}` The proportional hazards hypothesis is tested using the Schoenfeld test, and the resultant p-value is provided in the results. Log-log plots are also calculated using the Kaplan-Meier survival estimator to provide a visual test for the proportional hazards hypothesis. The function returns a list with the method called, the estimation of VE (CI95%), the p-value of the Schoenfeld test, and the log-log plot.
