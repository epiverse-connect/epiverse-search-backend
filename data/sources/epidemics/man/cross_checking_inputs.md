# Cross-check model elements

```r
.cross_check_intervention(x, population, allowed_targets)

.cross_check_vaccination(x, population, doses)

.cross_check_timedep(x, allowed_targets)

.cross_check_popchange(x, population)
```

## Arguments

- `x`: Model input to be checked. The expected value of `x` depends on the function:
    
     * `.cross_check_intervention()`: A named list of `\<intervention\>` objects;
     * `.cross_check_vaccination()`: A `\<vaccination\>` object;
     * `.cross_check_timedep()`: A named list of functions with two arguments, `time` and `x`, typically returning `x` as a function of `time`;
     * `.cross_check_popchange()`: A named list with two elements, `time` and `values`, describing the times and values by which the number of susceptibles changes in an epidemic model.
- `population`: An object of the `population` class, which holds a population contact matrix, a demography vector, and the initial conditions of each demographic group. See `population()`.
- `allowed_targets`: The model components, or infection parameters, that the model input `x` affects.
- `doses`: The expected number of vaccination doses.

## Returns

 * `.cross_check_intervention()` returns a named list with at least the elements "contacts" describing a `\<contacts_intervention\>` on `population`
   
   (if this is among the allowed targets), and a `\<rate_intervention\>` on the transmission rate parameter. If these are present in `x`, they are returned as is, or substituted if missing. Any other interventions are also returned. If `x` is `NULL`, dummy contact and rate interventions are returned in a list.
 * `.cross_check_vaccination()` returns `x` after checking that it is suitable for `population`, or a dummy vaccination regime with `doses` number of doses for each age group.
 * `.cross_check_timedep()` returns `x` if `x` is not `NULL`, otherwise returns a dummy function operating on the transmission rate parameter by default; see `.no_time_dependence()`;
 * `.cross_check_popchange()` returns `x` after checks against `population` if `x` is not `NULL`, otherwise returns a dummy list with no population change; see `.no_population_change()`.

Check model elements for compatibility with the population in an epidemic model, returning compatible dummy values when model elements are not applied, and erroring appropriately when model elements are not compatible with the population characteristics.
