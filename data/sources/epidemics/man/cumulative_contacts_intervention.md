# Calculate the Cumulative Effect of Interventions on Social Contacts

```r
cumulative_contacts_intervention(t, time_begin, time_end, reduction)

intervention_on_cm(t, cm, time_begin, time_end, cr)
```

## Arguments

- `t`: The current time.
- `time_begin`: A numeric vector of the start times of all interventions being modelled.
- `time_end`: A numeric vector of the end times of all interventions being modelled. Must be the same length as `time_begin`.
- `reduction`: A numeric matrix where rows give the effect of interventions on each demographic group, and the columns give the proportion reduction in contacts. When two interventions overlap, the proportions are **added**, for a maximum possible value of 1.0 (i.e., no contacts).
- `cm`: A numeric matrix of social contacts between demographic groups.

## Returns

`cumulative_contacts_intervention()` returns a numeric vector of the proportion reduction in contacts for each demographic group.

`intervention_on_cm()` returns the contact matrix `cm` scaled by the cumulative effect of any active interventions.
