# Constructor for the super-class and sub-classes

```r
new_intervention(
  name = NA_character_,
  time_begin,
  time_end,
  reduction,
  ...,
  class
)

new_contacts_intervention(name, time_begin, time_end, reduction)

new_rate_intervention(name, time_begin, time_end, reduction)
```

## Arguments

- `name`: String for the name of the intervention.
- `time_begin`: A matrix with a single element giving the start time of the intervention.
- `time_end`: A matrix with a single element giving the end time of the intervention.
- `reduction`: A matrix with a single column and as many rows as there are demographic groups to be targeted by the intervention. See `intervention()`
    
    for details on the types of intervention that can be created and the requirements for the type of `reduction`.
- `...`: Any other parameters to be passed to the constructor.
- `class`: A string giving the type of the intervention; used to generate intervention sub-classes.

## Returns

`new_intervention()` returns an object that inherits from the `<intervention>` class. `new_contacts_intervention()` returns an object that is a sub-class of `<intervention>` called `<contacts_intervention>`. `new_rate_intervention()` returns an object that is a sub-class of `<intervention>` called `<rate_intervention>`.
