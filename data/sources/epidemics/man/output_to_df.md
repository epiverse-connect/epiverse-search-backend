# Return ODE model output as a data.table

```r
.output_to_df(output, population, compartments)

.output_to_df_ebola(output, population, compartments)
```

## Arguments

- `output`: The model output, which must be a two element list (for epidemic) models, with the names "x" and "time", where "x" represents the condition of each compartment at each timestep in "time".
- `population`: A `<population>` object corresponding to the population used in the epidemic model. The `<population>` object is used to generate the names of the demographic groups, if these are named.
- `compartments`: A vector for the model compartment names.

## Returns

A `<data.table>` with the columns "compartment", "demography_group", "value", and "time"; these specify the epidemiological compartment, the name of the demography group, the number of individuals of that group in the compartment, and the model timestep, respectively. Names for the demographic groups are generated if no names are provided in the `population` object; these are of the form "demo_group_X".
