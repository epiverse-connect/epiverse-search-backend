# Assert properties of a `population` object

```r
assert_population(x, compartments, demography_vector = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- `x`: A `<population>` object.
- `compartments`: A character vector giving the names of model compartments whose length is taken as the reference for the number of columns in the `initial_conditions` matrix in `x`.
- `demography_vector`: An optional numeric vector whose length is used to check the length of the demography vector present in `x`.

## Returns

Silently returns the `<population>` object `x`. Primarily called for its side effects of throwing errors when `x` does not meet certain requirements.

Assert that objects of the `population` class have the parameters expected by an epidemic model. See `population()` and specific epidemic functions to check the population parameters required by each model. This function is for internal use in argument checking functions.
