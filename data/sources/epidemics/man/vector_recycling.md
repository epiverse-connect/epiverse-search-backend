# Vector recyclability checks and vector recycling

```r
.test_recyclable(x)

.recycle_vectors(x)
```

## Arguments

- `x`: A list of vectors to be checked for compliance with Tidyverse recycling rules, or to be recycled. When `x` is a list to be recycled, two cases are envisaged: all elements of `x` are expected to be of the same length, or, all but one element of `x` are scalars.

## Returns

`.test_recyclable` returns a single logical value. `.recycle_vectors` returns a list of vectors recycled to the same length following Tidyverse recycling rules.

Internal functions to check whether vectors can be recycled and to recycle vectors.

## Details

Note that `.test_recyclable()` will return vectors of unequal lengths if `x`

does not comply with length rules. This compliance is not enforced as this function is only expected to be used internally, after a call to `.test_recyclable()` (e.g. in a `stopifnot()`).
