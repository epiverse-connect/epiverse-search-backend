# Apply interventions to rate parameters

```r
.intervention_on_rates(t, interventions, parameters)
```

## Arguments

- `t`: A single number for the simulation time.
- `interventions`: A named list of `list`-like objects that each have at least the three members `"time_begin"`, `"time_end"`, and `"reduction"`. These are used to calculate the effect on each of the named parameters in the simulation.
- `parameters`: A named list of numeric parameters affected by `interventions`. This represents the model parameters, such as the transmission rate, `\beta`, or the recovery rate, `\gamma`.

## Returns

A named list of the same length as `parameters`, with the same names. These parameters can then be used in a timestep of an ODE model.
