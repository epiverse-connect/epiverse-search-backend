# Construct a `<epichains_summary>` object

```r
.new_epichains_summary(
  chains_summary,
  n_chains,
  statistic,
  offspring_dist,
  stat_threshold
)
```

## Arguments

- `chains_summary`: A numeric `<vector>` of chain sizes and lengths.
- `n_chains`: Number of chains to simulate.
- `statistic`: The chain statistic to track as the stopping criteria for each chain being simulated when `stat_threshold` is not `Inf`; A `<string>`. It can be one of:
    
     * "size": the total number of cases produced by a chain before it goes extinct.
     * "length": the total number of generations reached by a chain before it goes extinct.
- `offspring_dist`: Offspring distribution: a `<function>` like the ones provided by R to generate random numbers from given distributions (e.g., `rpois` for Poisson). More specifically, the function needs to accept at least one argument, `n`, which is the number of random numbers to generate. It can accept further arguments, which will be passed on to the random number generating functions. Examples that can be provided here are `rpois` for Poisson distributed offspring, `rnbinom` for negative binomial offspring, or custom functions.
- `stat_threshold`: A stopping criterion for individual chain simulations; a positive number coercible to integer. When any chain's cumulative statistic reaches or surpasses `stat_threshold`, that chain ends. It also serves as a censoring limit so that results above the specified value, are set to `Inf`. Defaults to `Inf`.

`new_epichains_summary()` constructs an `<epichains_summary>` object from a supplied `<vector>` of chain sizes or lengths. It also stores extra attributes passed as individual arguments.

`new_epichains_summary()` is meant to be lazy and performant, by creating the object without checking the arguments for correctness. It is not safe to call `new_epichains_summary()` on its own as is called within `epichains_summary()` after the arguments have been checked. To create a new `<epichains_summary>` object safely, use `epichains_summary()`.
