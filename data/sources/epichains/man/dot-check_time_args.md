# Check inputs that control time events

```r
.check_time_args(tf_specified, tf, generation_time, t0)
```

## Arguments

- `tf_specified`: `<logical>`; Whether the `tf` argument is specified. Only makes sense in the context where this function is called, i.e., in `simulate_chains()`. If `tf` is specified, generation_time must be specified.
- `tf`: A number for the cut-off for the infection times (if generation time is given); Defaults to `Inf`.
- `generation_time`: The generation time function; the name of a user-defined named or anonymous function with only one argument `n`, representing the number of generation times to sample.
- `t0`: Start time (if generation time is given); either a single value or a vector of same length as `n_chains` (number of initial cases) with corresponding initial times. Defaults to 0, meaning all cases started at time 0.

## Returns

`NULL`; called for side effects

This function checks the time-related inputs, i.e., start time of each chain, `t0`, the end time of the simulation, `tf`, and the generation time, generation_time. It also checks that the generation_time argument is specified if `tf` is specified as these go hand-in-hand.
