# Estimate the log-likelihood/likelihood for observed branching processes

```r
likelihood(
  chains,
  statistic = c("size", "length"),
  offspring_dist,
  nsim_obs,
  obs_prob = 1,
  stat_threshold = Inf,
  log = TRUE,
  exclude = NULL,
  individual = FALSE,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- `chains`: Vector of chain summaries (sizes/lengths). Can be a `<numeric>` vector or an object of class `<epichains>` or `<epichains_summary>` (obtained from `simulate_chains()` or `simulate_chain_stats()`). See examples below.
- `statistic`: The chain statistic to track as the stopping criteria for each chain being simulated when `stat_threshold` is not `Inf`; A `<string>`. It can be one of:
    
     * "size": the total number of cases produced by a chain before it goes extinct.
     * "length": the total number of generations reached by a chain before it goes extinct.
- `offspring_dist`: Offspring distribution: a `<function>` like the ones provided by R to generate random numbers from given distributions (e.g., `rpois` for Poisson). More specifically, the function needs to accept at least one argument, `n`, which is the number of random numbers to generate. It can accept further arguments, which will be passed on to the random number generating functions. Examples that can be provided here are `rpois` for Poisson distributed offspring, `rnbinom` for negative binomial offspring, or custom functions.
- `nsim_obs`: Number of simulations to be used to approximate the log-likelihood/likelihood if `obs_prob < 1` (imperfect observation). If `obs_prob == 1`, this argument is ignored.
- `obs_prob`: Observation probability. A number (probability) between 0 and 1. A value greater than 0 but less 1 implies imperfect observation and simulations will be used to approximate the (log)likelihood. This will also require specifying `nsim_obs`. In the simulation, the observation process is assumed to be constant.
- `stat_threshold`: A stopping criterion for individual chain simulations; a positive number coercible to integer. When any chain's cumulative statistic reaches or surpasses `stat_threshold`, that chain ends. It also serves as a censoring limit so that results above the specified value, are set to `Inf`. Defaults to `Inf`. NOTE: For objects of class `<epichains>` or `<epichains_summary>`, the `stat_threshold` used in the simulation is extracted and used here so if this argument is specified, it is ignored and a warning is thrown.
- `log`: Should the log-likelihoods be transformed to likelihoods? Logical. Defaults to `TRUE`.
- `exclude`: A vector of indices of the sizes/lengths to exclude from the log-likelihood calculation.
- `individual`: Logical; If TRUE, a vector of individual log-likelihood/likelihood contributions will be returned rather than the sum/product.
- `...`: any parameters to pass to `simulate_chain_stats`

## Returns

If `log = TRUE`

 * A joint log-likelihood (sum of individual log-likelihoods), if `individual == FALSE` (default) and `obs_prob == 1` (default), or
 * A list of individual log-likelihoods, if `individual == TRUE` and `obs_prob == 1` (default), or
 * A list of individual log-likelihoods (same length as `nsim_obs`), if `individual == TRUE` and `0 \<= obs_prob \< 1`, or
 * A vector of joint log-likelihoods (same length as `nsim_obs`), if individual == FALSE and `0 \<= obs_prob \< 1` (imperfect observation).

If `log = FALSE`, the same structure of outputs as above are returned, except that likelihoods, instead of log-likelihoods, are calculated in all cases. Moreover, the joint likelihoods are the product, instead of the sum, of the individual likelihoods.
