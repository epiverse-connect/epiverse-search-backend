# Check if constructed random number generator for offspring exists and has an `n` argument.

```r
.check_offspring_func_valid(offspring_dist)
```

## Arguments

- `offspring_dist`: Offspring distribution: a `<function>` like the ones provided by R to generate random numbers from given distributions (e.g., `rpois` for Poisson). More specifically, the function needs to accept at least one argument, `n`, which is the number of random numbers to generate. It can accept further arguments, which will be passed on to the random number generating functions. Examples that can be provided here are `rpois` for Poisson distributed offspring, `rnbinom` for negative binomial offspring, or custom functions.

Check if constructed random number generator for offspring exists and has an `n` argument.
