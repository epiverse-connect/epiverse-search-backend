# Log-likelihood of the summary (size/length) of chains with generic offspring distribution

```r
.offspring_ll(x, offspring_dist, statistic, nsim_offspring = 100, ...)
```

## Arguments

- `x`: A numeric vector of chain summaries (sizes/lengths).
- `offspring_dist`: Offspring distribution: a `<function>` like the ones provided by R to generate random numbers from given distributions (e.g., `rpois` for Poisson). More specifically, the function needs to accept at least one argument, `n`, which is the number of random numbers to generate. It can accept further arguments, which will be passed on to the random number generating functions. Examples that can be provided here are `rpois` for Poisson distributed offspring, `rnbinom` for negative binomial offspring, or custom functions.
- `statistic`: The chain statistic to track as the stopping criteria for each chain being simulated when `stat_threshold` is not `Inf`; A `<string>`. It can be one of:
    
     * "size": the total number of cases produced by a chain before it goes extinct.
     * "length": the total number of generations reached by a chain before it goes extinct.
- `nsim_offspring`: Number of simulations of the offspring distribution for approximating the distribution of the chain statistic summary (size/length)
- `...`: any parameters to pass to `simulate_chain_stats`

## Returns

A numeric vector of log-likelihood values.

The log-likelihoods are calculated with a crude approximation using simulated chain summaries by linearly approximating any missing values in the empirical cumulative distribution function (ecdf).
