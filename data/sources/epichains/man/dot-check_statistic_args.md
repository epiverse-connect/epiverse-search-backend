# Check that the `statistic` and `stat_threshold` arguments are valid

```r
.check_statistic_args(statistic, stat_threshold)
```

## Arguments

- `statistic`: The chain statistic to track as the stopping criteria for each chain being simulated when `stat_threshold` is not `Inf`; A `<string>`. It can be one of:
    
     * "size": the total number of cases produced by a chain before it goes extinct.
     * "length": the total number of generations reached by a chain before it goes extinct.
- `stat_threshold`: A stopping criterion for individual chain simulations; a positive number coercible to integer. When any chain's cumulative statistic reaches or surpasses `stat_threshold`, that chain ends. Defaults to `Inf`. For example, if `statistic = "size"` and `stat_threshold = 10`, then any chain that produces 10 or more cases will stop. Note that setting `stat_threshold` does not guarantee that all chains will stop at the same value.

## Returns

NULL; called for side effects

The function treats these two arguments as related and checks them in one place to remove repeated checks in several places in the package.
