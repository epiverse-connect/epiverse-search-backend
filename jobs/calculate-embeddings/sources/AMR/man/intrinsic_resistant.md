# Data Set with Bacterial Intrinsic Resistance

## Format

A tibble with 134 634 observations and 2 variables:

 * `mo`
   
   Microorganism ID
 * `ab`
   
   Antibiotic ID

```r
intrinsic_resistant
```

## Description

Data set containing defined intrinsic resistance by EUCAST of all bug-drug combinations.

## Details

This data set is based on ['EUCAST Expert Rules' and 'EUCAST Intrinsic Resistance and Unusual Phenotypes' v3.3](https://www.eucast.org/expert_rules_and_expected_phenotypes) (2021).

### Direct download

 Like all data sets in this package, this data set is publicly available for download in the following formats: R, MS Excel, Apache Feather, Apache Parquet, SPSS, SAS, and Stata. Please visit [our website for the download links](https://msberends.github.io/AMR/articles/datasets.html). The actual files are of course available on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/msberends/AMR/tree/main/data-raw).

They allow for machine reading EUCAST and CLSI guidelines , which is almost impossible with the MS Excel and PDF files distributed by EUCAST and CLSI.

## Examples

```r
intrinsic_resistant
