# Calculate the Mean AMR Distance

```r
mean_amr_distance(x, ...)

## S3 method for class 'sir'
mean_amr_distance(x, ..., combine_SI = TRUE)

## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
mean_amr_distance(x, ..., combine_SI = TRUE)

amr_distance_from_row(amr_distance, row)
```

## Arguments

- `x`: a vector of class sir , mic or disk , or a data.frame containing columns of any of these classes
- `...`: variables to select (supports tidyselect language such as `column1:column4` and `where(is.mic)`, and can thus also be antibiotic selectors
- `combine_SI`: a logical to indicate whether all values of S and I must be merged into one, so the input only consists of S+I vs. R (susceptible vs. resistant) - the default is `TRUE`
- `amr_distance`: the outcome of `mean_amr_distance()`
- `row`: an index, such as a row number

## Description

Calculates a normalised mean for antimicrobial resistance between multiple observations, to help to identify similar isolates without comparing antibiograms by hand.

## Details

The mean AMR distance is effectively [the Z-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score); a normalised numeric value to compare AMR test results which can help to identify similar isolates, without comparing antibiograms by hand.

MIC values (see `as.mic()`) are transformed with `log2()` first; their distance is thus calculated as `(log2(x) - mean(log2(x))) / sd(log2(x))`.

SIR values (see `as.sir()`) are transformed using `"S"` = 1, `"I"` = 2, and `"R"` = 3. If `combine_SI` is `TRUE` (default), the `"I"` will be considered to be 1.

For data sets, the mean AMR distance will be calculated per column, after which the mean per row will be returned, see **Examples**.

Use `amr_distance_from_row()` to subtract distances from the distance of one row, see **Examples**.

## Interpretation

 Isolates with distances less than 0.01 difference from each other should be considered similar. Differences lower than 0.025 should be considered suspicious.

## Examples

```r
sir <- random_sir(10)
sir
mean_amr_distance(sir)

mic <- random_mic(10)
mic
mean_amr_distance(mic)
# equal to the Z-score of their log2:
(log2(mic) - mean(log2(mic))) / sd(log2(mic))

disk <- random_disk(10)
disk
mean_amr_distance(disk)

y <- data.frame(
  id = LETTERS[1:10],
  amox = random_sir(10, ab = "amox", mo = "Escherichia coli"),
  cipr = random_disk(10, ab = "cipr", mo = "Escherichia coli"),
  gent = random_mic(10, ab = "gent", mo = "Escherichia coli"),
  tobr = random_mic(10, ab = "tobr", mo = "Escherichia coli")
)
y
mean_amr_distance(y)
y$amr_distance <- mean_amr_distance(y, where(is.mic))
y[order(y$amr_distance), ]

if (require("dplyr")) {
  y %>%
    mutate(
      amr_distance = mean_amr_distance(y),
      check_id_C = amr_distance_from_row(amr_distance, id == "C")
    ) %>%
    arrange(check_id_C)
}
if (require("dplyr")) {
  # support for groups
  example_isolates %>%
    filter(mo_genus() == "Enterococcus" & mo_species() != "") %>%
    select(mo, TCY, carbapenems()) %>%
    group_by(mo) %>%
    mutate(dist = mean_amr_distance(.)) %>%
    arrange(mo, dist)
}
```
