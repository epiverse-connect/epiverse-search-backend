# Determine Clinical or Epidemic Episodes

```r
get_episode(x, episode_days = NULL, case_free_days = NULL, ...)

is_new_episode(x, episode_days = NULL, case_free_days = NULL, ...)
```

## Arguments

- `x`: vector of dates (class `Date` or `POSIXt`), will be sorted internally to determine episodes
- `episode_days`: episode length in days to specify the time period after which a new episode begins, can also be less than a day or `Inf`, see **Details**
- `case_free_days`: (inter-epidemic) interval length in days after which a new episode will start, can also be less than a day or `Inf`, see **Details**
- `...`: ignored, only in place to allow future extensions

## Returns

 * `get_episode()`: an integer vector
 * `is_new_episode()`: a logical vector

## Description

These functions determine which items in a vector can be considered (the start of) a new episode. This can be used to determine clinical episodes for any epidemiological analysis. The `get_episode()` function returns the index number of the episode per group, while the `is_new_episode()` function returns `TRUE` for every new `get_episode()` index. Both absolute and relative episode determination are supported.

## Details

Episodes can be determined in two ways: absolute and relative.

1. Absolute
   
   This method uses `episode_days` to define an episode length in days, after which a new episode will start. A common use case in AMR data analysis is microbial epidemiology: episodes of **S. aureus** bacteraemia in ICU patients for example. The episode length could then be 30 days, so that new **S. aureus** isolates after an ICU episode of 30 days will be considered a different (or new) episode.
   
   Thus, this method counts since the start of the previous episode .
2. Relative
   
   This method uses `case_free_days` to quantify the duration of case-free days (the inter-epidemic interval), after which a new episode will start. A common use case is infectious disease epidemiology: episodes of norovirus outbreaks in a hospital for example. The case-free period could then be 14 days, so that new norovirus cases after that time will be considered a different (or new) episode.
   
   Thus, this methods counts since the last case in the previous episode .

In a table:

||||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Date|Using  `episode_days = 7`|Using  `case_free_days = 7`|
|2023-01-01|1|1|
|2023-01-02|1|1|
|2023-01-05|1|1|
|2023-01-08|2**|1|
|2023-02-21|3|2***|
|2023-02-22|3|2|
|2023-02-23|3|2|
|2023-02-24|3|2|
|2023-03-01|4|2|

** This marks the start of a new episode, because 8 January 2023 is more than 7 days since the start of the previous episode (1 January 2023). 

*** This marks the start of a new episode, because 21 January 2023 is more than 7 days since the last case in the previous episode (8 January 2023).


Either `episode_days` or `case_free_days` must be provided in the function.

### Difference between `get_episode()` and `is_new_episode()`

 The `get_episode()` function returns the index number of the episode, so all cases/patients/isolates in the first episode will have the number 1, all cases/patients/isolates in the second episode will have the number 2, etc.

The `is_new_episode()` function on the other hand, returns `TRUE` for every new `get_episode()` index.

To specify, when setting `episode_days = 365` (using method 1 as explained above), this is how the two functions differ:

|||||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|patient|date|`get_episode()`|`is_new_episode()`|
|A|2019-01-01|1|TRUE|
|A|2019-03-01|1|FALSE|
|A|2021-01-01|2|TRUE|
|B|2008-01-01|1|TRUE|
|B|2008-01-01|1|FALSE|
|C|2020-01-01|1|TRUE|

### Other

 The `first_isolate()` function is a wrapper around the `is_new_episode()` function, but is more efficient for data sets containing microorganism codes or names and allows for different isolate selection methods.

The `dplyr` package is not required for these functions to work, but these episode functions do support variable grouping and work conveniently inside `dplyr` verbs such as `filter()`, `mutate()` and `summarise()`.

## Examples

```r
# difference between absolute and relative determination of episodes:
x <- data.frame(dates = as.Date(c(
  "2021-01-01",
  "2021-01-02",
  "2021-01-05",
  "2021-01-08",
  "2021-02-21",
  "2021-02-22",
  "2021-02-23",
  "2021-02-24",
  "2021-03-01",
  "2021-03-01"
)))
x$absolute <- get_episode(x$dates, episode_days = 7)
x$relative <- get_episode(x$dates, case_free_days = 7)
x


# `example_isolates` is a data set available in the AMR package.
# See ?example_isolates
df <- example_isolates[sample(seq_len(2000), size = 100), ]

get_episode(df$date, episode_days = 60) # indices
is_new_episode(df$date, episode_days = 60) # TRUE/FALSE

# filter on results from the third 60-day episode only, using base R
df[which(get_episode(df$date, 60) == 3), ]

# the functions also work for less than a day, e.g. to include one per hour:
get_episode(
  c(
    Sys.time(),
    Sys.time() + 60 * 60
  ),
  episode_days = 1 / 24
)


if (require("dplyr")) {
  # is_new_episode() can also be used in dplyr verbs to determine patient
  # episodes based on any (combination of) grouping variables:
  df %>%
    mutate(condition = sample(
      x = c("A", "B", "C"),
      size = 100,
      replace = TRUE
    )) %>%
    group_by(patient, condition) %>%
    mutate(new_episode = is_new_episode(date, 365)) %>%
    select(patient, date, condition, new_episode) %>%
    arrange(patient, condition, date)
}

if (require("dplyr")) {
  df %>%
    group_by(ward, patient) %>%
    transmute(date,
      patient,
      new_index = get_episode(date, 60),
      new_logical = is_new_episode(date, 60)
    ) %>%
    arrange(patient, ward, date)
}

if (require("dplyr")) {
  df %>%
    group_by(ward) %>%
    summarise(
      n_patients = n_distinct(patient),
      n_episodes_365 = sum(is_new_episode(date, episode_days = 365)),
      n_episodes_60 = sum(is_new_episode(date, episode_days = 60)),
      n_episodes_30 = sum(is_new_episode(date, episode_days = 30))
    )
}

# grouping on patients and microorganisms leads to the same
# results as first_isolate() when using 'episode-based':
if (require("dplyr")) {
  x <- df %>%
    filter_first_isolate(
      include_unknown = TRUE,
      method = "episode-based"
    )

  y <- df %>%
    group_by(patient, mo) %>%
    filter(is_new_episode(date, 365)) %>%
    ungroup()

  identical(x, y)
}

# but is_new_episode() has a lot more flexibility than first_isolate(),
# since you can now group on anything that seems relevant:
if (require("dplyr")) {
  df %>%
    group_by(patient, mo, ward) %>%
    mutate(flag_episode = is_new_episode(date, 365)) %>%
    select(group_vars(.), flag_episode)
}
```
